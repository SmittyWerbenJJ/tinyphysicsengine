- Would be nice if we could typefef TPE_Vec4 as TPE_Unit[4] and TPE_Vec3 as
  TPE_Unit[3] to save the space (many operations just use vec4 as vec3 and waste
  space with the unused w component) -- and we can, but function then can't
  return these types :((( THINK ABOUT THIS
- BETTER VIBRATION HANDLING: there are issues, e.g. body stabilizes on a platform,
  then the platform moves underneath it and it doesn't fall over the edge, or a
  quickly moving body micro-colliding with floor will be stopped (create an
  energy threshold)
