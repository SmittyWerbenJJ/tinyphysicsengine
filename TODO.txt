TODO:
- zero weight joints should behave how?
- collision callbacks, ability to custom handle collision response
- debug draw inactive bodies with different color?
- test different tick lengths
- air friction
- test env functions with a single distinct point near camera
- test/handle: collision where the velocity goes "away" from the collision (can
  happen e.g. if one body is hit by a faster body OR by manual manipulation with
  velocities)

DONE:
- zero sized joints should never collide (can be useful) <- NO because 0 size
  can also mean just small size (due to size being stored divided)
- when waking a body by collision, maybe set the disable count to lower values,
  to handle situations in which two touching bodies wouldn't allow each other
  to ever get disabled
- non-rotating bodies
