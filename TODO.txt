TODO:
- zero weight joints should behave how?
- non-rotating bodies
- collision callbacks, ability to custom handle collision response
- debug draw inactive bodies with different color?

DONE:
- zero sized joints should never collide (can be useful) <- NO because 0 size
  can also mean just small size (due to size being stored divided)
- when waking a body by collision, maybe set the disable count to lower values,
  to handle situations in which two touching bodies wouldn't allow each other
  to ever get disabled
